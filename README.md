Project: Build a News Site

Instructions
You will make a news site and it's up to you what it will be about: it could be tech, sports, dinosaurs or avocados. This project focuses on practising what you've learned about responsive design and the layout techniques of CSS Grid and Flexbox.

I created a news website for cats. Before I started I looked at other news sites for inspiration. I wanted to use flexbox and grid to practise what I learned while also having fun with the design and layout. I used ChatGPT for ideas on headlines for the news articles.
If I had more time I would add more articles to the main page and also create more pages.
